# Escutcheon Theme - Tarknaussus' Modified Version
Heavily modified version of the Escutcheon Theme by Automatic.  This is tailored to my new Wordpress site.

### Original Features
With its smoky color palette and bold typography, Escutcheon is the perfect theme for writers who want to stand apart from the rest. A minimalist blog page gives just enough information to entice your readers, while individual blog posts and pages are stylish and easy to read.
