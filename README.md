With its smoky color palette and bold typography, Escutcheon is the perfect theme for writers who want to stand apart from the rest. A minimalist blog page gives just enough information to entice your readers, while individual blog posts and pages are stylish and easy to read.

The original template is available at [https://wordpress.com/theme/escutcheon](https://wordpress.com/theme/escutcheon)

### Added Features
1. Added Adobe Fonts Support for my personal use.
2. Rewrote colour code to use CSS variables so I can change the scheme in CSS rather than having to find/edit every single reference.
3. Adjusted typeface sizes to EM.

### Currently Working On:
Removing as much responsive code in the CSS to do a rewrite of it.  Changing text to em means a lot of it is redundant as for some reason the template developers decided hard-coded text sizes in px values was the way to go.
